  The UI consists of a shopping section with a light grey background that centers everything. Inside, a grid layout adapts to screen size, displaying product cards for each item (like laptops or smartwatches). Each card has a white background, containing a product image, title, and a shop link.

  When you hover over a card, it grows slightly to create a more interactive feel. The images stretch to fit the width of the card, and the titles are clearly displayed underneath. The shop links turn from blue to orange when hovered.
